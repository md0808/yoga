      <p>
        If you're able to support what I'm working on and what I'm offering, I
        deeply appreciate it. I try to offer as much as I can in a way that is
        accessible to people regardless of their finanical circumstances.
        Anything that you're able to offer, not only helps me to continue, but
        it also allows me to be more inclusive of the people who need these
        resources, but are unable to offer anything in return.
