      <p>
        If you're able to support what I'm working on and what I'm offering, I
        deeply appreciate it. I offer as much as I can to people regardless of
        their finanical circumstances. Anything that you're able to offer, not
        only helps me to continue, but it also allows me support people who need
        these resources, but are not able to pay for them.
