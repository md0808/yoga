        This is a collection of resources, ways to connect with me and support
        my work that I have put together to make it a little easier for people
        to practice yoga.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I am a 200hr RYT, trained through the Kripalu School of Yoga and
        Ayurveda. I also hold a 85hr Registered Prenatal Yoga Certification from
        Urban Breath Yoga. I started practicing yoga as a teenager. I was
        fortunate to have been introduced to yoga by someone who taught to use
        it as a form of introspective movement. The focus was on having a
        conversation with your body rather than mastering methods of
        manipulation. I was desperately in need of a break from manipulating my
        body, as I believe most people are. There are many valid ways to
        approach yoga, but I try to offer the things that yoga are to me that
        goes beyond a sleek workout. Cultivating skills to find balance and
        respite in our lives is central to what I practice and what I aim to
        bring to others. Above all, I hope to offer people who join my classes
        tools for enjoying movement and feeling empowered to trust what comes
        from within.

        When not under lock-down, I teach yoga classes to large and small groups
        of people in Kansas City as well as working with people one-on-one. I
        still do that, but currently, its through Zoom. I have experience
        working individually with people of all experience and ability levels
        ranging from clients with chronological illnesses and physical
        disabilities to professional athletes and dancers. In addtion to my
        formal trainings, in 2014 I lived and worked at the Kripalu School of
        Yoga and Ayurveda in Stockbridge, Massachusetts which exposed me to a
        depth and diversity of movement and wellness practices including yoga,
        qigong, and free form dance. I'm also a regular meditator, deeply
        influenced by the practices learned at my first Vipassana meditation in
        Dehradun, India.
